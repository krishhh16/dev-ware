# Problem statement
<h3> 
  There are a lot of aspiring developers who aspire to get a remote job, and get the perks of sitting in your home, wearking pajamas and make a living out of it(yes, that's how lazy some of us programmers are)
</h3>
<h3>
  But asides from aspiration, one needs to learn how to present themselves in front of the ideal employer who can see that you are useful to them. But it's not an easy journey to build your skills in the technology you are learning, it sometimes take months to actually build something people like!!
</h3>
<h3>
  But there is a con to just working hard on your skills!! You might be the best python developer in your country that could potentially do the job of 10 engineers! But in reality you are in your dorm room, just cramming for the next exam and writing assignments. It's frustrating to know you are good while not getting the benefits of it.
</h3>
<h2>
  But every problem has a solution at the end of the day, but before hearing the solutions, let's understand where we wanna look at to solve it?
   <ol>
     <li>Social media presence is essential for the growth of a developer's career because it not only exposes you to new people, but also present you with the oppertunities that you might not even have thought of</li>
     <li>Writing the right message to a potential employer(founder, HR etc.), presenting yourself as a problem solver and product oriented dev, and also knowing their needs can highly increase the chance of getting a reply back and schedule an interview</li>
     <li>Writing engaging content + uploading content in a huge volume is a big factor in improving your social media presence</li>
   </ol>
</h2>

<h3>
  But it sounds so much of a pain to be doing all this daily, apart from the hustle of your main craft! It includes:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Post 5-7 posts in linked and X
    </li>
    <li>
      Maintain post quality and content consistently
    </li>
    <li>
      Craft the right message to send to the potential employer, making it personalized, and also showing genuine interest in the project that you will be working on
    </li>
  </ol>
</h3>
<h3>
  Sounds like a long day of work already right? So here's what we can help you do:-

    </li>
  </ol>
